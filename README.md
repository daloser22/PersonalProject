# PersonalProject
I have upload this file to save my final version of Final Project University Career (Telecommunications Enginieering at UPV).
In this project you can see the code to develop a pulsioximeter based on Arduino UNO microcontroller. 
Sorry for the sintaxis in the code. I was a amateur software student!
